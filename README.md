# Go Bindings for LXC (Linux Containers)

This package implements [Go](http://golang.org) bindings for the [LXC](http://linuxcontainers.org/) C API.

## Requirements

This package requires [LXC 0.9+](https://github.com/lxc/lxc/releases) and [Go 1.x](https://code.google.com/p/go/downloads/list).

It has been tested on 

+ Ubuntu 12.10 (quantal) by manually installing LXC 0.9 
+ Ubuntu 13.04 (raring) by using distribution [provided packages](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/raring/+package/lxc)
+ Ubuntu 13.10 (saucy) by using distribution [provided packages](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/saucy/+package/lxc)

## Installing

The typical `go get github.com/caglar10ur/lxc` will install LXC Go Bindings.

## Documentation

Documentation can be found at [GoDoc](http://godoc.org/github.com/caglar10ur/lxc)

## Examples

See the [examples](https://github.com/caglar10ur/lxc/tree/master/examples) directory for some.

## Notes

Note that as we donâ€™t have full user namespaces support at the moment, any code using the LXC API needs to run as root.

Also please be aware that LXC C API is not considered stable until LXC 1.0 release. Development branch (see below) is currently **under heavy development with incompatible changes** and will be merged to master once LXC 1.0 released.

## Contributing

We'd love to see LXC improve to contribute to it;

* **Fork** the repository
* **Modify** your fork
* Ensure your fork **passes all tests**
* **Send** a pull request
	* Bonus points if the pull request includes *what* you changed, *why* you changed it, and *tests* attached.
	* For the love of all that is holy, please use `go fmt` *before* you send the pull request.

We'll review it and merge it in if it's appropriate.

## Development branch

If you are interested with upcoming LXC version (staging tree) then please use the **devel** branch.
