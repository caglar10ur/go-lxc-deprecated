{"name":"lxc","tagline":"Go Bindings for LXC (Linux Containers)","body":"# Go Bindings for LXC (Linux Containers)\r\n\r\nThis package implements [Go](http://golang.org) bindings for the [LXC](http://linuxcontainers.org/) C API.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nThis package requires [LXC 0.9+](https://github.com/lxc/lxc/releases) and [Go 1.x](https://code.google.com/p/go/downloads/list).\r\n\r\nIt has been tested on \r\n\r\n+ Ubuntu 12.10 (quantal) by manually installing LXC 0.9 \r\n+ Ubuntu 13.04 (raring) by using distribution [provided packages](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/raring/+package/lxc)\r\n+ Ubuntu 13.10 (saucy) by using distribution [provided packages](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/saucy/+package/lxc)\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\n\r\nThe typical `go get github.com/caglar10ur/lxc` will install LXC Go Bindings.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nDocumentation can be found at [GoDoc](http://godoc.org/github.com/caglar10ur/lxc)\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nSee the [examples](https://github.com/caglar10ur/lxc/tree/master/examples) directory for some.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nNote that as we donâ€™t have full user namespaces support at the moment, any code using the LXC API needs to run as root.\r\n\r\nAlso please be aware that LXC C API is not considered stable until LXC 1.0 release. Development branch (see below) is currently **under heavy development with incompatible changes** and will be merged to master once LXC 1.0 released.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nWe'd love to see LXC improve to contribute to it;\r\n\r\n* **Fork** the repository\r\n* **Modify** your fork\r\n* Ensure your fork **passes all tests**\r\n* **Send** a pull request\r\n\t* Bonus points if the pull request includes *what* you changed, *why* you changed it, and *tests* attached.\r\n\t* For the love of all that is holy, please use `go fmt` *before* you send the pull request.\r\n\r\nWe'll review it and merge it in if it's appropriate.\r\n\r\n## Development branch\r\n\r\nIf you are interested with upcoming LXC version (staging tree) then please use the **devel** branch.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
